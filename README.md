# 170 Web Development: Expense Tracker Application

This practice project focuses on implementing concepts learned in the Web Development course, which includes lessons on storing session data, validating form inputs, and using a layout.erb file for shared content. This small Sinatra application allows a user to keep track of her expenses and then sort them by month or year.
